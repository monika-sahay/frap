# Getting Started

## Quick Start Guide

Follow the Quick Start Guide to set up your first Frap project and create your first route.

## Project Setup
Clone the Frap repository or download it from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```
3. Running the Application
Run the application with the following command:

```
python run.py
```
Your Frap web application should now be running locally. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the "Hello, World!" example.

Project Setup

Before you start building your web application with Frap, let's go over the project structure:

- **app/**: This directory contains your application logic and is where you define your routes, templates, and responses.
- **utils/**: Store utility modules and helper functions in this directory.
- ** server/**: Contains server-related code, such as custom server handlers.
- **run.py**: The entry point of your application, where you run the server.
- **templates/**: Place your HTML templates in this directory.

## Routing

Understand how Frap handles routing and how to map URL paths to route handlers.
Frap provides a straightforward way to define routes for your web application. You can map URLs to specific functions using decorators.

### Defining Routes

To define a route, use the `@app.route()` decorator. For example:

```python
from app.app import App

app = App(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index(request):
    return Response("Hello, World!")

```
In this example, the / URL is mapped to the index function. When a user accesses the root URL, they will see "Hello, World!" as the response.

## Creating Routes

Discover how to define route handlers for your web application and handle different URL paths.
- Define a Route Handler
In your routes.py file, import the App class from app.app and use it to define your route handlers:

```
from app.app import App

app = App(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index(request):
    return Response("Hello, World!")
```
In this example, the / URL is mapped to the index function.
- Running the Application
To run your application, execute the run.py script:
```
python run.py
```
Your Frap web application is now running, and you can access it in your web browser.


# Request Handling

## Request Object

Learn about the Request object, which provides access to incoming HTTP request data.
### Handling HTTP Methods
You can specify which HTTP methods a route should respond to by providing a list of methods to the decorator:

```
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login(request):
    # Your login logic here
```
In this case, the login route will respond to both GET and POST requests.
